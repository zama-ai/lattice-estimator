This `Sage <http://sagemath.org>`__ module provides functions for estimating the concrete security
of
`Learning with Errors <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_with_errors>`__,
`SIS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_integer_solution_problem>`__ and
`NTRU <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTRU>`__ instances.

The main purpose of this estimator is to give designers an easy way to choose parameters resisting
known attacks and to enable cryptanalysts to compare their results and ideas with other techniques
known in the literature.

Quick Start
-----------

- Usage ::

    >>> from estimator import *
    >>> Kyber512
    LWEParameters(n=512, q=3329, Xs=D(σ=1.22), Xe=D(σ=1.00), m=1024, tag='Kyber 512')

    >>> primal_usvp(Kyber512)
    rop: ≈2^141.2, red: ≈2^141.2, δ: 1.004111, β: 382, d: 973, tag: usvp
    
    >>> primal_bdd(Kyber512)
    rop: ≈2^137.8, red: ≈2^136.5, svp: ≈2^137.1, β: 365, η: 400, d: 981, tag: bdd

Status
------

We do not have feature parity with the `old estimator <https://bitbucket.org/malb/lwe-estimator/src/master/>`__ yet:

- ``[x]`` |lwe-primal-binder| :doc:`Primal attack on LWE <../algorithms/lwe-primal>` 
- ``[x]`` |lwe-bkw-binder| :doc:`Coded-BKW attack on LWE <../algorithms/lwe-bkw>` 
- ``[X]`` |gb-binder| :doc:`Aroroa-GB attack on LWE <../algorithms/gb>`
- ``[X]`` :doc:`Dual attack on LWE <../algorithms/lwe-dual>`

We are also planning:

- ``[ ]`` Attacks on NTRU pulic keys (using overstretched parameters)
- ``[ ]`` SIS attacks
         
Evolution
---------

This code is evolving, new results are added and bugs are fixed. Hence, estimations from earlier
versions might not match current estimations. This is annoying but unavoidable. We recommend to also
state the commit that was used when referencing this project.
